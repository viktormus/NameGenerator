# NameGenerator
Software that generates Finnish (first) names.

**Background:** a friend of mine was graduating from university. He had lots of house plants, some of which had names. So, I had the idea to code, as part of a graduation gift, a name generator for his plants.

**How to use:** There are two .exe files. 'Win' works on Windows. 'Universal' should work on Windows, macOS, and Linux... though I've only tried it on Windows.
